Where I keep a sanity check over my emacs config

## How it works:
* init.el: emacs will run this file for initialization
* my-packages.el: define package libraries, declare & install packages
* my-loadpackages.el: load requirements & theirs configs
* my-noexternals.el: config for built-in emacs stuffs
* my-key-bindings.el: keep a list of all kbds for reference
